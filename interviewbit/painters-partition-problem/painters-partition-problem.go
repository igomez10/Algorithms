You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}.

There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a
painter takes to paint 1 unit of board.

You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any
painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.
